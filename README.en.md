## SICLickster
A browser extension that automatically clicks _Answer_ when playing SIGame.

### Usage
SIClickster is disabled by default.

You can enable it in-game at any point by clicking on its icon in your browser's toolbar.\
The badge on the extension icon should switch from OFF to ON.

When activated, the extension will automatically click the _Answer_ button in SIGame as soon as the game allows you to answer.\
Be careful in games without false starts: the extension will click _Answer_ as soon as the question is selected.\
Only activate the extension when you see the question and want to win the button.

After clicking once, the extension will __automatically disable__. You need to activate it for every question you want to answer.

If you change your mind, you can switch the extension off at any point before it clicks _Answer_ for you. Just click the icon again to do so.
